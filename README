This is file README for Moscow ML 2.00 for Linux/Unix (June 2000)

EXTENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

The current version 2.00 of Moscow ML

    * implements the full Standard ML language, as revised 1997, 
      including Modules and some extensions
    * yet is backwards compatible with versions prior to 2.00
    * implements large parts of the new SML Basis Library
    * implements separate compilation 
    * can produce compact stand-alone executables (a la Caml Light)
    * supports quotations and antiquotations, useful for metaprogramming
    * supports dynamic linking of external functions under Linux (x86
      and Alpha), FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Digital Unix, HP-UX,
      MacOS, and MS Windows'95/98/NT

New in version 2.00 of Moscow ML

   * The full SML Modules language (structures, signatures, and functors) 
     is now supported, thanks to Claudio Russo.  Also, several extensions 
     to the SML Modules language are provided:
      - higher-order functors: functors may be defined within structures 
        and functors
      - first-class modules: structures and functors may be packed and 
        then handled as Core language values, which may then be unpacked 
        as structures or functors again
      - recursive modules: signatures and structures may be recursively 
        defined
   * Value polymorphism has become friendlier: non-generalizable free
     type variables are left free, and become instantiated (once only)
     when the bound variable is used
   * Added facilities for creating and communicating with subprocesses
     (structure Unix and Signal from SML Basis Library).
   * Added facilities for efficient functional generation of HTML code
     (structure Msp); also supports the writing of ML Server Page scripts.
   * Added facilities setting and accessing `cookies' in CGI scripts
     (structure Mosmlcookie), thanks to Hans Molin, Uppsala, Sweden.
   * The Gdimage structure now produces PNG images (using Thomas 
     Boutell's gd library).

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Compilation under Unix is best done using GNU make, gcc, and Perl.  A
binary installation requires 5 MB disk space; a source installation
requires 25 MB disk space.

    Department of Mathematics and Physics, Royal Veterinary and
    Agricultural University, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, 
    Denmark.  Much of the work was done at the Technical University of
    Denmark, and while visiting AT&T Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, USA.

Moscow ML owes much to:
    * the CAML Light implementation by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez
      (INRIA, Rocquencourt, France); especially the Caml Light bytecode
      generator and the runtime system;
    * the ML Kit by Lars Birkedal, Nick Rothwell, Mads Tofte and David Turner
      (Copenhagen University, Denmark, and Edinburgh University, Scotland);
    * inspiration from the SML/NJ compiler developed at Princeton
      University and AT&T Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, USA; 
    * the good work by Doug Currie, Flavors Technology, USA, on the
      MacOS port and many improvements; and
    * feedback, contributions, and useful suggestions, in particular
      from Ken Friis Larsen, but also from Jonas Barklund, Mike Gordon,
      Michael Norrish, Konrad Slind, Jakob Lichtenberg, Hans Molin, and 
      numerous other people.
