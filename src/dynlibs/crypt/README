Foreign function interface: how to invoke C functions from Moscow ML
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows how to call the C function crypt (used for password
encryption) from Moscow ML.  

If the example fails to compile with the message
	ld: cannot open -lcrypt: No such file or directory 
then try deleting -lcrypt from the libcrypt.so line in the Makefile;
probably crypt() is defined in the standard C library.

This directory contains three files:

        crypt.c         Defines the C function ml_crypt, to be invoked 
                        from Moscow ML

        Makefile        Compiles crypt.c to a dynamically loadable library
                        (DLL) called libcrypt.so

        crypt.sml       Shows how to load the libcrypt.so library into 
                        Moscow ML and how to invoke the ml_crypt function

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

To compile and run the example:

        make
        mosml crypt.sml
