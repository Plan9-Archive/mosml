Interface to the gd graphics package
------------------------------------

This directory provides a Moscow ML interface to Thomas Boutell's gd
graphics package version 1.7.3, which supports PNG images.

It consists of the following files:

        mgd.c           Implements the dynamic library libmgd.so which 
                        interfaces Moscow ML to the gd library.

You must have the following components:
        
        gd              Can be found at http://www.boutell.com/gd/

        libpng          See http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/

        zlib            See http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/

        Dynlib          The Moscow ML foreign (C) function interface.
                        Supported for Linux, Solaris, MS Win32, MacOS,
                        Digital Unix, and HP-UX

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

1. Edit the mgd/Makefile to make GDDIR point to the directory in
   which you installed gd.

2. Compile mgd.c:

        make

3. Install libmgd.so in the directory determined by LIBDIR in 
   src/Makefile.inc:

        make install

4. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the LIBDIR directory.

        For tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LIBDIR
        For bash: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBDIR

5. Try the library:

        make test

Possible future improvements

JPEG images (when gd 2.0 comes out)

Dynamically adding new fonts from ML
