Interface to GNU gdbm persistent hashtables
-------------------------------------------

This directory provides a C interface to the GNU gdbm implementation
of persistent hashtables.

It consists of the following files:

        mgdbm.c         Implements the dynamic library libmgdbm.so which 
                        interfaces Moscow ML to the GNU gdbm library.

You must have the following components:
        
        GNU gdbm        Can be found many places on the Internet, such as
                        http://www.sunsite.auc.dk/ftp/pub/gnu/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz
                        A Win32 port was made by Roth (www.roth.net), 
                        get it from ftp://ftp.roth.net/pub/ntperl/gdbm/

        Dynlib          The Moscow ML foreign (C) function interface.
                        Supported for Linux, Solaris, MS Win32, MacOS,
	                Digital Unix, and HP-UX.

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

1. Edit the mgdbm/Makefile to make GDBMDIR point to the directory in
   which you installed gdbm.

2. Compile mgdbm.c:

        make

3. Install libmgdbm.so in the directory determined by LIBDIR in 
   src/Makefile.inc:

        make install

4. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the LIBDIR directory.

        For tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LIBDIR
        For bash: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBDIR

5. Test the library:

        make test
