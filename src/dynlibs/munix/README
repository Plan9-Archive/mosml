The SML Basis Library structures Unix and Signal
------------------------------------------------

*** This release has not been tested systematically ***

This directory provides the runtime implementation of the Unix and
Signal structures from the SML Basis Library.

The following files are included:

        munix.c         Implements the dynamic library libmunix.so which 
                        provides the execute, executeInEnv, kill, and reap 
                        implementations.

        sieve.c         A C program used for testing the Unix structure.

        testunix.sml    Very rudimentary test of the Unix structure.

You must have the following components:
        
        Dynlib          The Moscow ML foreign (C) function interface.
                        Supported for Linux, Solaris, MS Win32, MacOS,
                        Digital Unix, and HP-UX

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

1. Compile the components:

        make

2. Install libmunix.so in the directory determined by LIBDIR in 
   src/Makefile.inc:

        make install

3. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the LIBDIR directory:

        For tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LIBDIR
        For bash: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBDIR

4. Try it:

        make test
