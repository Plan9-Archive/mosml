1999-05-06: Initial version.
1999-06-21: Nearly ready. Discovered problem with bools and mysql.
1999-07-06: Made the final changes to the files. Should be consistent
            with Peters Postgres interface after Peter commit some
            proposed changes
1999-08-05: Sent to Peter.

1999-08-08 Peter:

+ mysql bytearray -- dropped

+ mysql bool -- dropped; do not try to emulate: a waste of time

+ mysql totype -- solved the problem by dropping it from the signature

+ make mysql pass testcases (changed dbresult, cmdtuples,
  resultstatus, dyntype, etc; additional testcases)

+ copytableto and auxiliaries rewritten for efficiency and bugfixes

+ mysql and pgsql avoid naked C pointers in ML values

+ mysql and pgsql user name and passwd

+ mysql cmdtuples (test5a) -- MySQL is broken

+ also changes to the Postgres interface, for consistency with MySQL

+ mysql copytablefrom --- recoded for efficiency and to handle line
  fragments, and put args containing several lines, as in PostgreSQL

2000-05-30: Severe inefficiency removed from function seekandgetrow.
