Sockets interface for Moscow ML
-------------------------------

*** This release has not been tested systematically ***

This directory provides a sockets interface for Moscow ML, roughly
conforming to the SML Basis Library.  It was implemented by Ken Larsen
and Peter Sestoft.  

The initial implementation was financed by the PROSPER project.

It consists of the following files:

        msocket.c       Implements the dynamic library libmsocket.so which 
                        provides socket primitives for Moscow ML.

You must have the following components:
        
        Dynlib          The Moscow ML foreign (C) function interface.
                        Supported for Linux, Solaris, MS Win32, MacOS,
	                Digital Unix, and HP-UX

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

1. Compile msocket.c:

        make

2. Install libmsocket.so in the directory determined by LIBDIR in 
   src/Makefile.inc:

        make install

3. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the LIBDIR directory.

	For tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LIBDIR
	For bash: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBDIR
