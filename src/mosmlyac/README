The source files for mosmlyac (in directory mosml/src/mosmlyac) are
based on those of camlyacc, distributed with the Caml Light system.
The Caml Light system was developed by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez
at INRIA Rocquencourt, France.  Camlyacc in turn is based on Bob
Corbett's Berkeley yacc, see below.

Mosmlyac was instrumental in bootstrapping Moscow ML in Moscow ML, and
is included here in the hope that it will be useful to others as well.

--- README file from camlyacc ----------------------------------------
This parser generator for Caml Light is based on Bob Corbett's public
domain Yacc, also known as Berkeley Yacc. It is a pleasure to
acknowledge Corbett's outstanding work.
