This directory contains the program used to create the database used
by the Moscow ML `help' function.  It will not work under MS DOS
because of the filename name truncation in DOS.

The program illustrates the use of several libraries.

The main program is makebase.  It reads the signatures in directory
mosml/lib/ and creates 

    * a help database in helpsigs.val
    * an ASCII format version of the database in index.txt
    * a LaTeX format version of the database in ../index.tex
    * HTML versions of the signature files, and an identifier index,
      with hyperlinks, in directory htmlsigs
    * a LaTeX format version of the signature files, with layout and 
      \index{...} markup, in file ../texsigsigs.tex 

To create the main program, type        

        make

To run the program thus compiled, type

        makebase

The program handles only signatures for (old) Moscow ML structure-mode
unit interfaces, as used in the Moscow ML library.
