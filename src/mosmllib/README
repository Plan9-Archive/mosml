Only the libraries marked S belong to the SML Basis Library; the
remaining ones are non-standard.

  S  means that the unit belongs to the new SML Basis Library.
  D  means that the unit is loaded if no `-P' option is specified (default).
  F  means that the unit is loaded if option `-P full' is specified.
  N  means that the unit is loaded if option `-P nj93' is specified.
  O  means that the unit is loaded if option `-P sml90' is specified.
  L  means that the unit is from the SML/NJ Library (version 0.2).

A unit U can be loaded into a Moscow ML interactive session by
evaluating
        load "U";
This will load U and any other units it depends on; it has no effect
if U is already loaded.

Any units required by a Moscow ML program are automatically included
when the program is linked.  For instance,
        mosmlc source.sml -o target
will automatically include unit U.uo if required by the program
source.sml.  Only the required parts of U will be included.

The library contains structures belonging to the new SML Basis
Library, as well as various non-standard utility structures, some of
which are from the Standard ML of New Jersey library (v. 0.2), and
some of which are from the Caml Light system.
