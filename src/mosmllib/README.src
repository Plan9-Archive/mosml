In general we discourage modifying the library source codefiles.  If
you modify them anyway, please note that:

* Some U.sml files are produced automatically from corresponding U.mlp
files by the C preprocessor; such U.sml files should never be edited
by hand.  Edit the U.mlp files instead.

* To recompile the library (which is NOT necessary unless you have
modified it), execute `make depend' and then `make' in this directory.
