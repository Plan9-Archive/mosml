This is the first implementation of mosmlpm, thus it probably contains
lot small bugs.  mosmlpm is modeled after the project manager
distributed with the ML Kit(http://www.it.edu/research/mlkit) designed
by Martin Elsman.  But mosmlpm does not share any code with the ML Kit
implementation.


Future plans:
-------------
* Make proper documentation together with Martin Elsman.  It is
  planed that mosmlpm and the project manager for the ML Kit should
  merge into one in a near future.

* Generalize the grammar for project files:
  + Allow more that just one toplevel import
  + Introduce an visibleimport form that exposes the identifiers for
    imported project files.

* Handle .sig files and resolve unitname conflicts (require support in
  mosmlc).

* Make a library so as project can be managed in a mosml session.


How to bootstrap:
-----------------
1. make
2. camlrunm mosmlpm mosmlpm.pm


Known Bugs:
-----------
* Poor (non-existent) error messages
* mosmlpm enters an infinite (well it is bound by the memory
  available) loop if the project files are cyclic
