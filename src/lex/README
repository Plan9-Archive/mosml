The source files for mosmllex (in directory mosml/src/lex) are based
on those of camllex, distributed with the Caml Light system.  The Caml
Light system was developed by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez at INRIA
Rocquencourt, France.

Mosmllex was instrumental in bootstrapping Moscow ML in Moscow ML, and
is included here in the hope that it will be useful to others as well.
