The Unix Makefile defines the following targets, which may be useful to hackers:

make regress  - builds the libraries in ../mosmllib and runs the test-suites
		in test/ ../mosmllib/test/ ../test/ (by calling make current) 
                using the current compiler (the one in this directory).
	        Useful for testing prior to boostrapping.

make promote  - promote the current binaries of the linker, compiler and toplevel to ../,
	        backing up the supplied originals in ../*.orig
	         
	        Use this prior to boostrapping the compiler, provided the runtime  	
                is unchanged.

make revert   - restore the linker, compiler and lexer originals (saved by make promote).
